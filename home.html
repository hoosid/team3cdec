                <i> More than 41,000 people have died across Turkey and Syria since a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck on Monday, as hopes of rescuing more survivors dwindle amid freezing conditions.
                
                The latest figures show that 41,181 have died across both countries.
                
                The death toll in Turkey has climbed to 29,605, Turkish Emergency Coordination Center SAKOM said Sunday</p>
